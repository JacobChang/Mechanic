## Project idea

The F# compiler needs to get files ordered in correct order for compilation, so that everything is declared before usage. 
There are some different opinions if this should be seen as a feature or as a limitation. This project won't settle this dispute, but it wants to make it easier for F# developers to maintain that order in fsproj files.
